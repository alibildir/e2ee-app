Flutter storage Maven repo was not declared in settings.gradle.kts

PR #27 — CLEAN fresh Flutter Android skeleton via
`flutter create --platforms=android` — required the audit to grow
fresh-skeleton preservation invariants S17-S20 so future sprints
that re-touch mobile/ (port VPN service, MethodChannels, screens)
cannot silently regress the buildable-artifact contract).

Verifies:
  1. All 4 workflows have ONLY workflow_dispatch trigger (no push/pull_request).
  2. android-debug.yml has subosito/flutter-action@v2 step.
  3. android-debug.yml's `Setup Flutter` step pins flutter-version
     (Sprint 9.6.2 fix — Sprint 9.6.1 had `channel: stable` only, which
     caused ${FLUTTER_HOME} to resolve to empty in the runner).
  4. android-debug.yml's `Generate local.properties` step writes flutter.sdk
     echo derived from `which flutter` (Sprint 9.6.2 fix — Sprint 9.6.1
     used `${FLUTTER_HOME}` which was empty, causing settings.gradle.kts
     `includeBuild("")` = `/packages/flutter_tools/gradle` to FAIL).
  5. android-debug.yml has `Verify Flutter SDK path` step
     (fast-fail signal BEFORE ./gradlew assembleDebug).
  6. ci.yml/ios.yml/android-release.yml have NO inputs.runner
     (matrix/single-runner workflows don't need it).
  7. **Sprint 9.6.3:** gradle-wrapper.properties distributionUrl must be
     >= 8.7.0 (Flutter 3.44.1 minimum).
  8. **Sprint 9.6.4:** mobile/android/build.gradle.kts AGP plugin version
     must be >= 8.6.0 (Flutter 3.44.1 minimum).
  9. **Sprint 9.6.5:** build.gradle.kts Kotlin plugin version must be
     >= 2.2 (Flutter 3.44.1 soon-dropped floor).
 10. **Sprint 9.6.6 (v2):** app/build.gradle.kts Kotlin DSL syntax check
     with 5 sub-checks (S1-S5):
     S1. real `import java.util.Properties` statement exists at line start
         (NOT substring in a comment — Sprint 9.6.5 had a false-positive
         match on a comment claiming the import was added).
     S2. real `import org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.dsl.JvmTarget` statement
         exists (required by kotlin { compilerOptions } block).
     S3. deprecated `kotlinOptions { jvmTarget = "..." }` block is NOT
         present in code (Kotlin 2.0+ deprecation warning treated as
         build error in CI by AGP 8.11.1 + Kotlin 2.2.20).
     S4. new `kotlin { compilerOptions { jvmTarget.set(JvmTarget.JVM_17) } }`
         block IS present in code (correct Kotlin 2.0+ replacement).
     S5. fully-qualified `java.util.Properties()` usage is NOT present
         in code (must use short form `Properties()` after the import).
 11. **Sprint 9.6.7 (v3):** android-debug.yml `flutter pub get` step check
      (S6):
      The CI runner resolves `./gradlew assembleDebug` →
      `:app:compileFlutterBuildDebug` which needs
      `mobile/.dart_tool/package_config.json`. That file is NEVER
      produced unless a step runs `flutter pub get` with
      `working-directory: ./mobile` (the Dart project root, where
      `pubspec.yaml` lives — NOT `./mobile/android`). S6 verifies:
      (a) step name matches "Install Flutter dependencies" (case-
          insensitive substring on parsed `name` field, not raw text),
      (b) step `run` field contains "flutter pub get",
      (c) step `working-directory` is EXACTLY "./mobile".
      Uses PyYAML-parsed step dicts (Sprint 9.6.5 comment-claim
      lesson reapplies — a comment claiming "we run flutter pub get"
      must NOT pass this audit).
 12. **Sprint 9.6.8 (v4):** mobile entry point check (S7) —
      `mobile/lib/main.dart` + `runApp(` + `ProviderScope` +
      `pubspec.yaml` `flutter_riverpod:` + `go_router:`. PyYAML-
      parsed pubspec deps (comment-claim lesson reapplies).
 13. **Sprint 9.6.9 (v5):** Android res/xml/ comment well-formedness
      (S8) — XML 1.0 `<!-- ... -->` may not contain `--`. Uses
      `xml.etree.ElementTree.fromstring` (well-formedness) + regex
      walk over comment bodies (content rule). aapt2 rejects the
      file with 'The string "--" is not permitted within comments'.
 14. **Sprint 9.6.10 (v6):** AndroidManifest merger-spec (S9) —
      no `package=` attr (AGP 8.11.1 ignores / AGP 9 rejects) +
      `xmlns:tools` declared + `tools:replace` (NOT `tools:remove`)
      co-exists with `android:usesCleartextTraffic` + gradle
      `namespace = "..."` declared (cross-check).
 15. **Sprint 9.6.11 (v7):** Android res/ skeleton (S10) — mipmap
      ic_launcher representation + `drawable/launch_background.xml`
      + `values/styles.xml` with `LaunchTheme` + `NormalTheme`.
 16. **Sprint 9.6.12 (v8):** mobile/.flutter-plugins-dependencies
      regen (S11) — file exists, parses as JSON via `json.load`
      (real parser, per the 9.6.x chain rule "audit must use a
      real parser, not a regex-grep heuristic"), `plugins.android[]`
      non-empty with `name` + `native_build` per entry. The Flutter
      Gradle plugin reads this file to wire engine JARs into the
      Kotlin compile classpath; without it, `compileDebugKotlin`
      fails with 40+ 'Unresolved reference embedding/FlutterActivity/
      FlutterEngine/MethodChannel' errors.
      [NB: S11 was right-but-insufficient. The actual root cause of
       the 9.6.12 / 9.6.13 live build FAIL was a missing
       `io.flutter:flutter_embedding_ktx` Maven coordinate in
       `app/build.gradle.kts` `dependencies { }` — a Kotlin-side
       issue. `.flutter-plugins-dependencies` is Dart-side
       metadata and does not contribute to the Kotlin classpath.
       S12 was added in Sprint 9.6.13 to close the Kotlin-side
       gap.]
 17. **Sprint 9.6.13 (v9):** app/build.gradle.kts
      `flutter_embedding_ktx` declared (S12) — the Maven
      coordinate `io.flutter:flutter_embedding_ktx:1.0.0-<engine
      _commit>` appears inside the `dependencies { }` block AND
      the `<engine_commit>` hash matches the value in
      `$flutterSdkPath/bin/internal/engine.version`. Without this
      dependency, `compileDebugKotlin` fails with 40+ "Unresolved
      reference embedding/FlutterActivity/FlutterEngine/
      MethodChannel" errors in MainActivity.kt + OpenE2eeVpnService.kt.
      Missing since PR-3 (the original Android Gradle scaffolding).
18. **Sprint 9.6.14 (v10):** Flutter engine Maven repo declared
       (S13) — `dependencyResolutionManagement { repositories { ...
       maven { url = uri("https://storage.googleapis.com/download.
       flutter.io") ... } } }` in `settings.gradle.kts` (or
       `app/build.gradle.kts` `repositories { }` as fallback).
       Without this, AGP-managed tasks (e.g.
       `:app:checkDebugAarMetadata`) cannot resolve
       `io.flutter:flutter_embedding_ktx` because the Flutter Gradle
       plugin auto-registers this repo only for the Dart-side
       `compileFlutterBuildDebug` task — NOT for AGP tasks.
  19. **Sprint 9.7.0 Item 5 (v11):** Gradle wrapper force-include
       (S17) — `mobile/android/gradlew` + `mobile/android/gradlew.bat`
       + `mobile/android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar` are TRACKED
       by git (via `git ls-files`, the same data source the audit
       chain has used since Sprint 9.6.1) AND the repo-root
       `.gitignore` has matching `!**/android/gradlew`,
       `!**/android/gradlew.bat`, `!**/android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar`
       re-include lines. Sprint 9.7.0 Item 1 wiped `mobile/` and
       re-scaffolded via `flutter create --platforms=android`; the
       default `flutter create` template excludes the wrapper as a
       "generated artifact" — a fresh clone without force-include
       would have no gradlew and the CI runner's `chmod +x
       ./mobile/android/gradlew` step would fail with "No such file
       or directory". This invariant prevents a future
       `flutter create` re-run from silently regressing the
       buildable-artifact contract.
  20. **Sprint 9.7.0 Item 5 (v11):** Fresh `flutter create`
       preservation (S18) — `mobile/pubspec.lock` is TRACKED by git,
       parses as YAML (real parser, per the 9.6.x chain rule), has
       a `packages.flutter` entry with `source: sdk` (Flutter SDK
       SHA pin), AND the repo-root `.gitignore` retains the
       mobile-specific Flutter exclusion rules
       (`**/android/.gradle/`, `**/android/local.properties`,
       `**/.dart_tool/`, `**/.flutter-plugins-dependencies`). Sprint
       9.7.0 Item 1 wiped the e2ee-app pubspec.lock and re-generated
       a fresh one via `flutter create` + `flutter pub get`; if a
       future sprint strips these rules or un-tracks pubspec.lock,
       CI reproducibility breaks (lockfile-driven SHA mismatch).
  21. **Sprint 9.7.0 Item 5 (v11):** Fresh `flutter create`
       local-level metadata tracked (S19) — `mobile/.metadata` AND
       `mobile/android/.gitignore` are both TRACKED by git. The
       `.metadata` file marks the directory as a Flutter project
       for tooling (IDE detection, `flutter doctor` heuristics); the
       `android/.gitignore` carries the un-ignore rules + rationale
       block specific to the Android subdir (see Sprint 9.7.0 Item 1
       attempt-2 delta). Without both, a `git clone` of the fresh
       skeleton is not a valid Flutter Android project from the
       tooling's point of view.
  22. **Sprint 9.7.0 Item 5 (v11):** pubspec.yaml baseline shape
        (S20) — `mobile/pubspec.yaml` parses as YAML (real parser)
        AND has the minimum keys every Flutter Android skeleton must
        have for `flutter pub get` + `flutter create --platforms=android`
        to round-trip cleanly: `name:`, `environment.sdk:`,
        `dependencies.flutter.sdk: flutter`,
        `dev_dependencies.flutter_test.sdk: flutter`. The fresh
        skeleton template generated by `flutter create` ships with
        all four; if a future sprint edits pubspec.yaml in a way that
        drops one (e.g. removes the `flutter_test` dev-dep), the
        `widget_test.dart` smoke test breaks and the foundation is
        compromised.
  23. **Sprint 10.1C:** PoolState debug-state fields (S33) —
        `mobile/lib/state/pool_provider.dart` declares BOTH
        `lastError` AND `lastSuccess` field literals. The active
        pool screen's `ref.listen<PoolState>(...)` snackbar
        handler reads these names verbatim. Removing either
        field re-introduces the silent-failure mode Owner flagged
        on 10.07.2026 22:21 ("hiç tepki yok gibi" — "feels like
        nothing is happening").
  24. **Sprint 10.1C:** ScaffoldMessenger snackbar in active pool
        screen (S34) — `mobile/lib/screens/active_pool_screen.dart`
        contains the literal
        `ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar`. Without the
        literal call, the `ref.listen<PoolState>(...)` block
        compiles to a no-op and the Owner-facing debug feedback
        is silently dropped.
  25. **Sprint 10.1C:** build-time API key (S35) — at least one
        of `mobile/lib/services/telemetry_service.dart` OR
        `mobile/lib/services/p2p_matcher.dart` contains the
        literal `String.fromEnvironment('API_KEY'`. Without the
        call, the `--dart-define API_KEY=<key>` build flag is
        silently ignored and the hardcoded placeholder reaches
        the wire (Owner directive 10.07.2026 22:25).
  26. **Sprint 10.1D:** auth_service.dart exists with POST +
        /api/v1/auth + user_id literals (S36) — the JWT auth
        flow files. The endpoint + body shape is the contract
        with the backend BFF aggregator.
  27. **Sprint 10.1D:** authHeaders() in telemetry_service or
        p2p_matcher (S37) — the protected endpoints must call
        `_auth.authHeaders()` (Future<Map<String, String>>),
        NOT send a static `Authorization: Bearer <key>` line.
  28. **Sprint 10.1D:** _tokenExpiresAt field in
        auth_service.dart (S38) — the JWT token-cache state.
        `getToken()` uses it for the 5-min pre-expiry refresh
        window (Owner directive 10.07.2026 22:33).
  29. **Sprint 10.1D:** invalidate() method in
        auth_service.dart (S39) — the 401-retry contract.
        Downstream services call `_auth.invalidate()` when the
        backend rejects the JWT; the next call re-auths.
  30. **Sprint 10.1E:** WhatsApp deep link Android Intent
        format in `whatsapp_deeplink_provider.dart` (S40) — the
        `whatsapp_deeplink_provider.dart` file must carry BOTH
        the `intent://send?` prefix AND the
        `#Intent;scheme=whatsapp;package=com.whatsapp;end` suffix
        literal. Sprint 10.0's `whatsapp://send?text=` scheme was
        unreliable on Android (MIUI / OEM ROMs silently no-op'd
        the launch); the new Android Intent URI forces
        PackageManager to route to the WhatsApp package. Both
        halves of the URI are load-bearing — dropping either
        makes the launch silently no-op.
   31. **Sprint 10.1E:** P2PMatcher uses `/api/v1/sessions`
        (S41) — the `p2p_matcher.dart` file must contain the
        literal `/api/v1/sessions` AND must NOT contain the
        literal `/api/v1/matches` (the 10.1B/10.1D path that
        404'd because the backend never had that route).
        Mobile-side filter (status=active, role=receiver,
        device_id_hash != self) replaces the missing server-side
        match endpoint per the brief's option C.
   32. **Sprint 10.1F:** AndroidManifest `<queries>` WhatsApp
        package visibility (S42) — the
        `mobile/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml` must
        carry a top-level `<queries>` block AND the literal
        `<package android:name="com.whatsapp" />` inside it
        (also `com.whatsapp.w4b` for WhatsApp Business). On
        Android 11+ (API 30+) the package-visibility filter
        blocks `canLaunchUrl(...)` for any package the app has
        not declared in `<queries>`, even when the package IS
        installed. The 10.1E Intent-URI fix
        (`intent://send?text=...#Intent;scheme=whatsapp;
        package=com.whatsapp;end`) is necessary but not
        sufficient — without the manifest declaration the
        platform returns `false` for the visibility probe.
        Sprint 10.1E deliverable Owner report 10.07.2026 23:29:
        "whatsapp yüklü değil diyor hala deeplink yine hatalı".
   33. **Sprint 10.1F:** MainActivity.kt `getSampledPackets`
        method-channel handler (S43) — the Kotlin file
        `mobile/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/opene2ee/opene2ee/
        MainActivity.kt` must contain a
        `when (call.method) { ... "getSampledPackets" -> ... }`
        dispatch block on the `opene2ee/vpn` MethodChannel.
        The Dart-side `VpnService` (Sprint 10.1B) calls
        `_channel.invokeMethod("getSampledPackets")` from
        `pool_provider.dart`'s 3-second poll loop; without the
        Kotlin handler the call raises
        `MissingPluginException(No implementation found for
        method getSampledPackets on channel opene2ee/vpn)`.
        Owner report 10.07.2026 23:29: 30 consecutive "Aktif
        Nöbet" calls all failed with this error. Sprint 10.1F
        wires the handler INLINE in MainActivity (mock for now;
        real `OpenE2eeVpnService` integration lands in Sprint
        10.2 via the port-vpn-service follow-up).

    """Sprint 9.6.7 v3: android-debug.yml `flutter pub get` step check.

    A live workflow_dispatch run AFTER Sprint 9.6.6 (PR planned #17,
    commit e57da24) FAILED at :app:compileFlutterBuildDebug with:
        "mobile/.dart_tool/package_config.json does not exist.
         Did you run this command from the same directory as your
         pubspec.yaml file?"
    The `flutter --version` step that exists at the end of the
    workflow is NOT a substitute for `flutter pub get` — it only
    prints the version, it does not generate the package_config.json
    file that the Flutter Android Gradle plugin reads at build time.

    The fix: add a new step
        - name: Install Flutter dependencies
          working-directory: ./mobile
          run: flutter pub get
    between the existing `Verify Flutter dependency cache` step
    (current step 9) and the existing `Build Debug APK` step
    (current step 10). `working-directory: ./mobile` is mandatory
    because `pubspec.yaml` lives in the Dart project root, not the
    Android Gradle subproject (`./mobile/android`).

    This check verifies all three properties on the SAME step:

      (a) Step name matches `Install Flutter dependencies` (case-
          insensitive substring match on the `name` field).
      (b) Step `run` field contains `flutter pub get` (case-
          insensitive substring).
      (c) Step `working-directory` is exactly `./mobile` (NOT
          `./mobile/android`, NOT absent, NOT empty).

    The check uses PyYAML-parsed step dicts (not raw text substring
    search) — applying the Sprint 9.6.5 lesson that a comment
    claiming "we run flutter pub get" must NOT pass the audit.

    Failure messages report the actual `working-directory` value
    seen (if any) so a future false-positive is debuggable.

    """Sprint 9.6.9 v5: XML comment well-formedness check (S8).

    The 9.6.8 live build (commit edd3023 on main, fast-forward
    merged by Owner) advanced past `compileFlutterBuildDebug` for
    the first time in the 9.6.x chain. The next task,
    `:app:mergeDebugResources`, failed because
    `mobile/android/app/src/main/res/xml/network_security_config.xml`
    contained XML comments with `--` runs (e.g. `---------------`).
    The XML 1.0 spec forbids `--` inside `<!-- ... -->`; Android's
    `aapt2` / `ResourceCompiler` enforces this and rejects the
    file with `The string "--" is not permitted within comments`.

    This check enforces the rule statically so a future
    regression cannot land:

      (a) Every `*.xml` under
          `mobile/android/app/src/main/res/xml/` parses as
          well-formed XML via `xml.etree.ElementTree.fromstring`
          (Python's stdlib XML 1.0 parser — same rule aapt2 uses
          up to differences in namespace handling).
      (b) No `<!-- ... -->` comment body contains a `--` run
          (the regex finds `--` INSIDE comments; the legitimate
          `<!--` opener and `-->` closer are stripped first by
          walking the comment match bounds).

    Implementation notes (apply 9.6.5 lesson): we DO NOT
    regex-grep raw text for `--` — we use `ET.fromstring` to
    validate well-formedness AND iterate the captured comment
    text from a regex pass to assert no `--` run lives inside.
    A comment that LEGITIMATELY contains the text "the `--`
    keyword" would still fail (correct: the only way to write
    that in XML is to break the comment into two comments,
    e.g. `<!-- the --><!--  keyword -->` — accepted XML
    limitation, see https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#sec-comments).

    Scope: only `mobile/android/app/src/main/res/xml/*.xml`.
    We do NOT scan `mobile/lib/` Dart sources, and we do NOT
    scan the broader `mobile/android/` tree (CI's `aapt2` is
    what cares about the resource dir, not arbitrary XML).

    `parseDebugLocalResources` (XML comments fixed). The next
    task, `:app:processDebugMainManifest`, failed because:

      (a) `mobile/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
          declared `package="com.opene2ee.opene2ee"` on the
          root `<manifest>` element. AGP 8.11.1 rejects this in
          favour of the `namespace` declared in
          `build.gradle.kts` ("Setting the namespace via the
          package attribute in the source AndroidManifest.xml is
          no longer supported"). The `namespace` is already at
          `mobile/android/app/build.gradle.kts:136`.

          (via `xml.etree.ElementTree` — same XML 1.0 parser
          rule aapt2 uses).
      (2) The root `<manifest>` element does NOT carry a
          `package` attribute. AGP 8.x ignores it; AGP 9 will

    The 9.6.10 live build (commit 5f3ee01 on main, fast-forward
    merged by Owner) advanced past `processDebugMainManifest` for
    the first time (manifest fix worked). The next task,
    `:app:processDebugResources`, failed because three Android
    resources referenced by AndroidManifest.xml were never
    generated:

      `mipmap/ic_launcher` (app icon)
      `style/LaunchTheme` (launch screen style)
      `style/NormalTheme` (normal theme style)

    The repo's `mobile/android/app/src/main/res/` contained only
    `xml/network_security_config.xml`. The rest of the Flutter
    Android resource skeleton (mipmap-*, drawable/launch_background.xml,
    values/styles.xml, values/colors.xml, values-night/styles.xml)
    was never generated. The repo has had no Flutter Android
    skeleton since PR-3.

    Sprint 9.6.11 ran `flutter create . --platforms=android` and
    kept ONLY the res/ additions (rejected any flutter create
    changes to the preservation list: MainActivity.kt, Android
    Manifest.xml, build.gradle.kts, lib/*, pubspec.yaml, test/).

    This check verifies that the skeleton stays intact:

      (a) `mobile/android/app/src/main/res/values/styles.xml`
          exists AND contains both `<style name="LaunchTheme">`
          AND `<style name="NormalTheme">` (parse with
          xml.etree.ElementTree). aapt2 rejects the manifest
          without these styles.
      (b) AT LEAST ONE mipmap representation of the app icon
          exists — either `mipmap-anydpi-v26/ic_launcher.xml`
          (adaptive icon) OR any density's
          `mipmap-{mdpi,hdpi,xhdpi,xxhdpi,xxxhdpi}/ic_launcher.png`
          (legacy raster). aapt2 rejects the manifest
          without `mipmap/ic_launcher`.
      (c) `mobile/android/app/src/main/res/drawable/launch_background.xml`
          exists. Referenced by `LaunchTheme`'s `windowBackground`.

    We do NOT check exact file contents (icon design, color palette,
    etc.) — a future visual design sprint can refine. The audit's

def check_flutter_plugins_dependencies_v8() -> list[str]:
    """Sprint 9.6.12 v8: mobile/.flutter-plugins-dependencies regen check (S11).

    The 9.6.11 live build (commit f4881cd on main, fast-forward
    merged by Owner) advanced past `processDebugResources` for the
    first time (resource skeleton fix worked). The next task,
    `:app:compileDebugKotlin`, failed with 40+ "Unresolved
    reference" errors in `MainActivity.kt` and `OpenE2eeVpnService.kt`:

        e: MainActivity.kt:39:19 Unresolved reference 'embedding'.
        e: MainActivity.kt:48:22 Unresolved reference 'FlutterActivity'.
        e: MainActivity.kt:57:37 Unresolved reference 'MethodChannel'.
        e: OpenE2eeVpnService.kt:103:19 Unresolved reference 'embedding'.
        e: OpenE2eeVpnService.kt:184:36 Unresolved reference 'FlutterEngine'.
        e: OpenE2eeVpnService.kt:251:32 Unresolved reference 'MethodChannel'.

    The Kotlin compiler cannot find `io.flutter.embedding.*` and
    `io.flutter.plugin.*` because the Flutter engine JAR is not on
    the compile classpath. The Flutter Gradle plugin (`app_plugin_
    loader.gradle` under `$FLUTTER_HOME/packages/flutter_tools/
    gradle/`) reads `mobile/.flutter-plugins-dependencies` to
    discover the set of Flutter plugins and wire their generated
    classes + the engine JARs into the Kotlin compile classpath.

    Sprint 9.6.7 added the `flutter pub get` step to
    `android-debug.yml` (S6 — `Install Flutter dependencies` with
    `working-directory: ./mobile`). That step regenerates
    `.flutter-plugins-dependencies` on the CI runner BEFORE the
    `Build Debug APK` step, so the engine JARs are wired into the
    classpath.

    However, the file is gitignored (`**/.flutter-plugins-
    dependencies` in repo-root `.gitignore` line 96), so when a
    Coder worktree is created from a clean main checkout, the file
    is ABSENT. `flutter pub get` must be run locally to regenerate
    it. If a future commit changes the pubspec dependency graph
    (adds/removes a Flutter plugin) without re-running `flutter
    pub get` AND the workflow's `flutter pub get` step is
    accidentally removed or misconfigured, the build will fail at
    `compileDebugKotlin` with the symptoms above.

    This check enforces the LOCAL pre-build state:

      (a) `mobile/.flutter-plugins-dependencies` exists.
      (b) The file parses as JSON via `json.load` (real parser,
          per the 9.6.x chain rule "audit must use a real
          parser, not a regex-grep heuristic").
      (c) `plugins.android` is a non-empty list (at least one
          Android plugin declared). Without this list, the
          Flutter Gradle plugin has no Android plugins to wire
          and (in some configurations) no engine JAR to add to
          the Kotlin classpath.
      (d) Each entry in `plugins.android` has both `name` (str)
          and `native_build` (bool) fields — the schema
          `flutter pub get` writes.

    Failure messages report the actual observed state (file
    missing / JSON parse error / empty array / missing fields)
    so a future regression is debuggable. We do NOT
    cross-validate against `mobile/pubspec.yaml` deps here — that
    is a stricter check that the live `flutter pub get` step is
    already responsible for (S6 invariant). This audit's job is
    "is the generated state consistent", not "do the pubspec
    deps match".

    Scope: only `mobile/.flutter-plugins-dependencies`. We do
    NOT scan the analogous `ios` array or any sibling
    Dart-side state — iOS / web / desktop plugins are not on
    the Android Kotlin classpath.

    """Sprint 9.6.13 v9: app/build.gradle.kts `flutter_embedding_ktx` check (S12).

    The 9.6.12 live build (commit b52a0f6 on main, fast-forward
    merged by Owner) FAILED at `:app:compileDebugKotlin` with
    40+ "Unresolved reference 'embedding' / 'FlutterActivity' /
    'FlutterEngine' / 'MethodChannel'" errors in `MainActivity.kt`
    and `OpenE2eeVpnService.kt` — IDENTICAL to the 9.6.11 failure.

    Sprint 9.6.12's Coder root-cause (Fix A: `.flutter-plugins-
    dependencies` was missing in the worktree) was a surface
    artifact, NOT the actual root cause. `.flutter-plugins-
    dependencies` is a JSON plugin-list artifact read by the
    Flutter Gradle plugin to wire Dart-side plugin code; it does
    NOT contribute to the Kotlin compile classpath.

    The REAL root cause (Mavis verified, Coder independently
    confirmed in Sprint 9.6.13 Phase 0): `mobile/android/app/
    build.gradle.kts` `dependencies { }` block was MISSING the
    `io.flutter:flutter_embedding_ktx` Maven coordinate. The
    `dev.flutter.flutter-gradle-plugin` plugin wires the engine
    JAR into `compileFlutterBuildDebug` (Dart side) but does NOT
    propagate it to `compileDebugKotlin` (Kotlin side, run by
    Android Gradle Plugin as a separate task). Every
    `io.flutter.embedding.*` and `io.flutter.plugin.*` import in
    `MainActivity.kt` (PR-22a) and `OpenE2eeVpnService.kt`
    (PR-28) failed to resolve.

    This dependency has been missing since PR-3 (the original
    Android Gradle scaffolding). PR-28 (Sprint 5) declared
    `id("dev.flutter.flutter-gradle-plugin")` and `flutter {
    source = "../.." }` but never added the Kotlin embedding JAR.
    From PR-3 through 9.6.11, `compileFlutterBuildDebug` always
    failed FIRST in the live build, so `compileDebugKotlin` never
    had a chance to fail and expose this gap. Sprint 9.6.11 fixed
    the res/ skeleton, so the build finally reached
    `compileDebugKotlin` and the missing dependency surfaced.

    The fix: add ONE line to the `dependencies { }` block:
        implementation("io.flutter:flutter_embedding_ktx:1.0.0-<engine_commit>")
    where `<engine_commit>` is the 40-char hex SHA from
    `$flutterSdkPath/bin/internal/engine.version`. The Maven
    artifact is published to https://storage.googleapis.com/
    download.flutter.io/ and maven.google.com; Gradle fetches it
    automatically when declared.

    This check enforces the post-fix state:

      (a) `mobile/android/app/build.gradle.kts` exists.
      (b) The file contains a `dependencies { ... }` block
          (substring match — we deliberately do NOT use a full
          Kotlin parser because the dependency block is short
          and substring is sufficient, AND a regex would risk the
          same false-positive pattern Sprint 9.6.5 audit had
          when substring matched a comment claiming a dependency
          was added but the file did not actually have it).
      (c) Inside the `dependencies { }` block, the string
          `io.flutter:flutter_embedding_ktx` appears (substring
          match within the block).
      (d) The version follows the `1.0.0-<40-char-hex>` pattern
          (regex `^1.0.0-[0-9a-f]{40}$` on the captured
          version string — the dot in `1.0.0` is a literal `.`,
          not a regex metachar).
      (e) The hash matches the value in
          `$flutterSdkPath/bin/internal/engine.version` (read it,
          compare as strings).

    Failure messages name the actual observed state so a future
    regression is debuggable (NOT a generic "this dependency is
    missing" string). The audit pinpoints which sub-check failed.

    Scope: only `mobile/android/app/build.gradle.kts`. We do NOT
    scan the workspace `build.gradle.kts` (root) or other module
    build files — the embedding JAR is a per-app dependency.

    """Sprint 9.6.14 v10: Flutter engine Maven repo config check (S13).

    The 9.6.13 live build (commit 7441667 on main, fast-forward
    merged by Owner) advanced past `:app:compileDebugKotlin` for
    the first time — Sprint 9.6.13's `flutter_embedding_ktx`
    dependency declaration worked. The next task,
    `:app:checkDebugAarMetadata`, FAILED with:

        Could not find io.flutter:flutter_embedding_ktx:
            1.0.0-c416acfeb8126e097f758c664aaa3da929e27da0.
        Searched in the following locations:
          - https://dl.google.com/dl/android/maven2/io/flutter/...
          - https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/io/flutter/...
          - https://storage.googleapis.com/download.flutter.io/io/flutter/...

    The Flutter Gradle plugin (`dev.flutter.flutter-gradle-plugin`)
    auto-registers the `storage.googleapis.com/download.flutter.io`
    repo for the Dart-side `compileFlutterBuildDebug` task
    classpath, but AGP-managed tasks like
    `:app:checkDebugAarMetadata` (Kotlin-side runtime classpath
    resolution) do NOT see those plugin-level registrations — they
    use ONLY the project-side repositories declared in
    `dependencyResolutionManagement` (settings.gradle.kts) or
    `repositories { }` (app/build.gradle.kts).

    This dependency has been missing since PR-28 (Sprint 5) set up
    the Flutter Gradle plugin for the first time. From PR-28
    through 9.6.13, `compileFlutterBuildDebug` always failed FIRST
    in the live build, so `checkDebugAarMetadata` never had a
    chance to fail and expose this gap. Sprint 9.6.13 fixed the
    `compileDebugKotlin` layer (Kotlin-side engine JAR on
    classpath); with that fixed, the build reached
    `checkDebugAarMetadata` and the Maven repo config gap surfaced.

    The artifact `io.flutter:flutter_embedding_ktx:1.0.0-<engine
    _commit>` is published ONLY at `https://storage.googleapis.com/
    download.flutter.io`. It is NOT on Google Maven or Maven
    Central. Gradle must be told to look there.

    This check enforces the post-fix state:

      (a) `mobile/android/settings.gradle.kts` contains a
          `dependencyResolutionManagement` block.
      (b) Inside that block (or in `app/build.gradle.kts` as a
          fallback), the URL `https://storage.googleapis.com/
          download.flutter.io` is declared via
          `maven { url = uri("...") }`.
      (c) The URL itself is well-formed (parseable as an https
          URL — we do NOT hit the network).

    Failure messages name the actual observed state so a future
    regression is debuggable.

    Scope: only `settings.gradle.kts` + `app/build.gradle.kts`.
    The workspace `build.gradle.kts` may have `allprojects {
    repositories { google(); mavenCentral() } }` (deprecated since
    Gradle 7), but those repos are ineffective when
    `dependencyResolutionManagement` is set with
    `PREFER_SETTINGS` mode — the audit correctly excludes the
    `allprojects` approach.

    Owner report 10.07.2026 23:29: "whatsapp yüklü değil diyor hala
    deeplink yine hatalı". Root cause: Android 11+ (API 30+) package
    visibility filter. `canLaunchUrl(...)` returns `false` for any
    package the app has not declared in `<queries>`, even when the
    package IS installed. Sprint 10.1E replaced the legacy
    `whatsapp://send?text=` scheme with the Android Intent URI
    `intent://send?text=...#Intent;scheme=whatsapp;package=com.whatsapp;end`
    — but the platform-side visibility check still needs the
    `<package android:name="com.whatsapp" />` line in the manifest
    to SEE the package at all.

    The fix:
        <manifest ...>
            <queries>
                <package android:name="com.whatsapp" />
                <package android:name="com.whatsapp.w4b" />
            </queries>
            ...
        </manifest>

    S42 verifies BOTH:
      (a) The manifest has a top-level `<queries>` block (XML
          namespace-agnostic — `ET.fromstring` parses it).
      (b) Inside that block there is at least one
          `<package android:name="com.whatsapp" />` element
          (we match by `com.whatsapp` literal in any
          package/@android:name attribute to avoid coupling
          to attribute-order / whitespace conventions).

    The `<intent>` form (used in S9 for VpnService) is also valid
    but broader — exposing ALL SEND intents. The `<package>` form
    is preferred per the Android docs and per the brief's privacy
    posture (only the two WhatsApp apps become visible, not the
    entire SEND intent space).

    Owner report 10.07.2026 23:29: "Aktif nöbet 30 çağrı yaptı hepsi
    aynı hata aldı MissingPluginException(No implementation found for
    method getSampledPackets on channel opene2ee/vpn". The Dart-side
    `VpnService` (Sprint 10.1B) calls
    `_channel.invokeMethod("getSampledPackets")` from
    `pool_provider.dart`'s 3-second poll loop. The Kotlin side had no
    handler — `OpenE2eeVpnService.attachFlutterEngine(...)` is
    `TODO(port-vpn-service)` (Sprint 9.7.0 Item 2) and not yet
    ported to the clean skeleton.

    Sprint 10.1F wires the handler INLINE in MainActivity (mock for
    now — real `OpenE2eeVpnService` integration lands in Sprint 10.2).
    The handler returns a single synthetic packet (IPv4 / TCP / 443)
    for `getSampledPackets` and string sentinels for `start` / `stop`
    / `status`. Without the handler the Dart call throws
    `MissingPluginException` on every poll, the `ref.listen<PoolState>`
    snackbar never fires `lastError`, and the user sees the same
    "Aktif nöbet" UI feedback on every screen.

    Sprint 11.0A — the `getSampledPackets` case moved from
    `MainActivity.kt` to `OpenE2eeVpnService.kt` (the real port-
    vpn-service integration). The audit accepts EITHER path:
    the inline mock in MainActivity (10.1F + 10.1G) OR the
    real handler in OpenE2eeVpnService (11.0A). A "both" state
    is also accepted (defensive — if a future sprint routes
    the call through MainActivity for some reason, the audit
    should not regress).

    S43 verifies the Kotlin file carries the case-literal. Real
    parser: a `when (call.method)` block (regex on the actual code,
    NOT a comment substring) AND the literal `"getSampledPackets"`
    inside that block. Sprint 9.6.5 lesson reapplies: a comment
    claiming "we handle getSampledPackets" must NOT pass — we strip
    `//` line comments AND `/* */` block comments first, then match.

    Audit scope (Sprint 11.0A v15 update): EITHER of
    `mobile/android/app/src/main/kotlin/com/opene2ee/opene2ee/

    """Sprint 11.0O: NO fake UI animation in 3 Dart files (S86).

    Owner 13:20 CRITICAL FINDING: the active pool screen
    shows animated packet + volunteer counts even when the
    VPN is NOT started. The Kotlin side was correct (Sprint
    11.0M audit dump proved `packetsObserved.incrementAnd
    Get` has exactly one site in `startReaderThread`). The
    Dart side still had Sprint 10.1A mock ticker leftover
    code that was never cleaned up:
      - `pool_provider.dart` had a `Timer.periodic` 3-second
        ticker that bumped `paketSayisi` and
        `gonulluSayisi` with no real network call.
      - `PoolState.initial()` returned mock values
        (`paketSayisi: 247`, `gonulluSayisi: 3`,
        `testEdilenler: {rcs, whatsapp}`, `paketGecmisi:
        [1,2,1,3,2,1,2,3,1,2]`).
      - `active_pool_screen.dart` had a `Future.delayed(
        Duration(seconds: 5), ...)` that showed a fake
        "Eşleşme bulundu!" snackbar 5s after the user
        toggled "Alıcı Ol" ON, regardless of any real
        backend response.

    11.0O removes all three and replaces them with REAL
    data sources:
      - `paketSayisi` accumulates from the cumulative
        `_vpn.getSampledPackets()` return value (the
        Kotlin TUN reader's `SampledPacket` list).
      - `gonulluSayisi` is the length of the peer list
        from `_matcher.findActiveReceivers(...)` (a real
        `GET /api/v1/sessions` call).
      - The "Eşleşme bulundu!" snackbar is fired by
        `ref.listen(lastSuccess)` in `build()`, not by a
        fake timer.

    This audit (S86) grep-asserts the invariant in THREE

def check_vpn_service_mtu_and_fragment_log_v31() -> list[str]:
    """Sprint 11.0P: OpenE2eeVpnService.kt has TUN_MTU=1400
    (mobile-safe, NOT 1500) + per-1000-packet MTU +
    fragment log breadcrumb (S87).

    Owner 13:50 root cause: the 1500-byte TUN MTU is too
    large for mobile networks. Turkcell 4G/5G uses
    GTP-U encapsulation (8-byte header + IPsec
    50-70-byte trailer) which means a 1500-byte TUN
    packet becomes 1500 + 78 = 1578 bytes on the wire.
    The mobile network drops any frame > 1500 bytes
    (the radio link MTU), so packets exit the TUN, hit
    the radio link, and are dropped silently. The Owner
    sees Chrome / WhatsApp "no internet" even though the
    TUN reader is capturing packets (1247 packets/2min
    logcat in Sprint 11.0O confirmed passthrough is
    real; the missing 30% of large packets that were
    dropped on the radio link is what the user
    experiences as "DNS / load failures").

    11.0P fix:
      1. Lower TUN_MTU from 1500 to 1400 (mobile-safe).
         1400 + 78 = 1478 < 1500 radio MTU.
      2. Add `ipFragmentCount: AtomicLong` field that
         increments when an IP packet's header has the
         MF (More Fragments) bit set OR a non-zero
         fragment offset.
      3. Emit a per-1000-packet `Log.d` breadcrumb:
         `startReaderThread: MTU=$TUN_MTU,
         packetsObserved=$total,
         ipFragmentCount=$fragments,
         fragmentRatePct=$pct`.
         The Owner can grep `adb logcat` for this line
         to verify a fragment rate < 0.1% (good)
         vs > 5% (MTU still too high).

    The check requires FOUR tokens in
    `OpenE2eeVpnService.kt` (comment-stripped):
      1. `TUN_MTU = 1400` literal present (NOT 1500).
         `TUN_MTU = 1500` is the anti-pattern (will
         fail this audit).
      2. `addDnsServer(PRIMARY_DNS` (or
         `addDnsServer(1.1.1.1`) — the DNS resolver is
         still required (the brief first said the fix
         was DNS; that was later corrected to MTU in
         11.0P OVERRIDE 2, but the DNS resolver must
         remain in place).
      3. `ipFragmentCount` field declared.
      4. The per-1000-packet `fragmentCount` /
         `fragmentRatePct` log breadcrumb is present in
         `startReaderThread`.

    Missing any of these re-opens the "Chrome/WhatsApp
    no internet" regression.

    """Sprint 11.0Q: active_pool_screen.dart + MainActivity.kt
    2-level VPN disconnect fallback (S88).

    Owner 14:14 symptom: tapping "Oturumu Bitir" on the
    active pool screen did NOT stop the VPN when the
    orchestrator's `sessionId` was null (stale state
    after a Dart VM restart). Pre-11.0Q, the handler
    had an early-return on null sessionId that showed
    "Aktif oturum yok" and never touched the VPN.
    Result: the user had to UNINSTALL the app or use
    the system Settings → Network → VPN page to stop
    the VPN. Critical UX bug.

    11.0Q fix: 2-level fallback.
      - LEVEL 1: try `VpnService.instance.stop()` with
        a 3s timeout + try/catch. The Kotlin service
        accepts the MethodChannel `stop` call and
        tears down the TUN + foreground notification
        cleanly. The 3s timeout is critical because
        the channel call can hang on OnePlus OxygenOS
        Magisk Zygisk fd-revoke.
      - LEVEL 2: if LEVEL 1 fails (timeout, exception,
        or no active session on the Kotlin side), call
        `MainActivity.disconnectVpn` via the
        `opene2ee/permissions` MethodChannel.
        MainActivity hard-stops the service via
        `stopService(Intent(this, OpenE2eeVpnService::
        class.java))` AND revokes the system VPN profile
        via `VpnService.prepare(this)`. This is the
        nuclear option that ALWAYS works.

    The check requires FIVE tokens across TWO files
    (comment-stripped):
      1. active_pool_screen.dart: `VpnService.instance
         .stop` + `.timeout(const Duration(seconds: 3))`
         + `TimeoutException` (LEVEL 1 path).
      2. active_pool_screen.dart: `opene2ee/permissions`
         MethodChannel + `disconnectVpn` invocation
         (LEVEL 2 path).
      3. active_pool_screen.dart: NO `if (_orchestrator
         .sessionId == null) { return; }` early-return
         (anti-pattern guard — the old code had this
         early-return that blocked the disconnect
         flow).
      4. MainActivity.kt: `disconnectVpn` method that
         calls both `stopService(Intent(this,
         OpenE2eeVpnService::class.java))` AND
         `VpnService.prepare(this)`.
      5. MainActivity.kt: `onPermissionsCall` `when`
         block lists `"disconnectVpn" -> disconnectVpn(
         result)` (so Dart can reach the method via
         the MethodChannel).

    Missing any of these re-opens the "Oturumu Bitir
    requires app uninstall" regression.

    """Sprint 11.0R: active_pool_screen.dart full state reset
    on disconnect (S89).

    Owner 15:03 EXTENDED: VPN kapatma 11.0Q worked
    (yesil snackbar, status bar temiz, skorlar
    yonlendirme) AMA two new bugs:
      1. Packet counter kept growing by 10 every 5s
         after disconnect (the PacketDrain
         ScheduledExecutorService kept pushing
         onPacketsSampled events to the still-live
         _packetSub subscription, which kept bumping
         _toplamPaket).
      2. The page didn't re-render — button text
         stayed "Oturumu Bitir" (didn't revert to
         "Başlat"), the pill stayed SAMPLING, etc.
         The UI was effectively frozen in the
         pre-disconnect state.

    11.0R does a full state reset after disconnect:
      1. _packetSub.cancel() + _stateSub.cancel() +
         _webrtcStateSub.cancel() — stop the stream
         subscriptions so no more onPacketsSampled /
         onStateChanged events arrive.
      2. _toplamPaket = 0 + _toplamTelemetri = 0 —
         clear the counter so the UI shows 0, not
         the stale pre-disconnect value.
      3. setState(() { ... }) with _vpnState = idle
         + _webrtcState = closed — forces a re-render
         so the button text + pill update.
      4. _disconnectInProgress = false — clears the
         single-flight guard.
      5. Navigate to /home/gorevler (NOT /home/skorlar)
         — the user lands on the main task list, and
         the Skorlar tab is reachable from the bottom
         nav bar. 11.0R EXTENDED brief change.
      6. Single-flight guard: _disconnectInProgress
         is set to true at the entry of _oturumuBitir
         and the button onPressed is `null` while
         in flight (prevents double-tap crashes).

    The check requires EIGHT tokens in
    active_pool_screen.dart (comment-stripped):
      1. _packetSub?.cancel() (or _packetSub.cancel())
         in _oturumuBitir.
      2. _stateSub?.cancel() in _oturumuBitir.
      3. _toplamPaket = 0 in _oturumuBitir (or in the
         setState body).
      4. _vpnState = VpnLifecycleState.idle (or
         equivalent reset) in the setState.
      5. setState(() { ... }) wrapping the resets.
      6. _disconnectInProgress = true at the entry of
         _oturumuBitir (the single-flight guard).
      7. _disconnectInProgress = false at the END of
         _oturumuBitir (the guard clears).
      8. context.go('/home/gorevler') in _oturumuBitir
         (11.0R EXTENDED navigation target).

    Missing any of these re-opens the "packet counter
    keeps growing after disconnect" regression.

    fix (`intent://send?text=...#Intent;scheme=whatsapp;package=com.
    whatsapp;end`) and the 10.1F `<queries>` AndroidManifest fix
    (Android 11+ package visibility), the snackbar on OnePlus 9 Pro
    (rooted, Magisk + LSPosed) still read "WhatsApp yüklü değil veya
    intent başarısız". The 10.1F snackbar was binary — it just said
    "intent başarısız" with no way to tell which tier (canLaunchUrl
    false vs. launch returned false vs. exception) failed. Owner
    could not reproduce the diagnostic in his bug report.

    Sprint 10.1G addresses both:

      (a) PRIMARY PATH — WhatsApp "click-to-chat" web URL:
              https://wa.me/?text=<urlencoded>
          wa.me is a public HTTPS domain whose App Links manifest
          routes Chrome Custom Tabs directly to the WhatsApp
          package. This path bypasses the Magisk / LSPosed
          intent-interception layer on OnePlus OxygenOS (verified on
          the OnePlus 9 Pro that motivated the sprint) and works
          on every Android OEM ROM in the Sprint 9 cross-OEM test
          matrix.

      (b) FALLBACK — the 10.1E intent:// Android Intent URI. Kept
          in the same provider file so the rare device where wa.me
          routing is not yet live can still try the older path.

      (c) DEBUG REASON — new `tryOpenWithReason()` API returns a
          `WhatsAppDeepLinkResult({bool ok, String? reason})` so
          the WhatsApp task detail screen's snackbar can show
          Owner exactly which tier succeeded / failed and why
          (canLaunchUrl=false vs. launch exception vs. her iki
          yöntem başarısız).

    S44 verifies all three:

      (1) `mobile/lib/state/whatsapp_deeplink_provider.dart`
          contains the `intent://send?text=` literal (Sprint 10.1E
          fallback tier — preserved from the post-10.1F state).
      (2) `mobile/lib/state/whatsapp_deeplink_provider.dart`
          contains the new `https://wa.me/?text=` literal (Sprint
          10.1G primary tier).
      (3) `mobile/lib/screens/whatsapp_task_detail_screen.dart`
          contains the literal `tryOpenWithReason` call (Sprint
          10.1G debug-reason API surface — the screen must
          migrate from the boolean `tryOpen()` so the snackbar
          can show the per-tier failure mode).

    Sub-check (3) catches a future regression where a developer
    reverts the screen to `tryOpen()` (the boolean wrapper) and
    loses the debug reason in the snackbar. Without the reason,
    Owner is back to the 10.1F binary snackbar — exactly the
    diagnostic the 10.1G sprint added `tryOpenWithReason()` to
    expose.

    Audit scope is two files:

      - `mobile/lib/state/whatsapp_deeplink_provider.dart`
        (S44 sub-checks 1+2)
      - `mobile/lib/screens/whatsapp_task_detail_screen.dart`
        (S44 sub-check 3)

    No comment-stripping is needed for the provider file — the
    three required literals are structural (the buildUri() and
    buildWaMeUri() helpers MUST reference them, otherwise the
    file would not compile). The screen file's `tryOpenWithReason`
    call is a top-level method invocation; a comment claiming
    "we call tryOpenWithReason" would still match the substring
    but Dart's compiler catches the missing import (the audit
    treats that as the call site being absent, not as a
    comment-vs-code false positive — see the Sprint 9.6.5 lesson
    on regex-grep false-positives; the substring pattern here
    is intentionally narrow).

    Failure messages report ALL three missing literals in a
    single finding so a fix-cycle can address them in one pass.

    """Sprint 11.0E: OpenE2eeVpnService.kt calls startForeground()
    within Android's 5-second foreground-service rule (S74).

    Regression guard for the OnePlus 9 Pro crash
    `android.app.RemoteServiceException: Context.startForegroundService()
    did not then call Service.startForeground()` at 10:29 on
    11.07.2026. The 5-second rule (in place since Android 8 /
    API 26) requires the service to call `startForeground(id,
    notification)` within 5 seconds of `startForegroundService(...)`
    being invoked; otherwise the system kills the service and
    crashes the app.

    Pre-Sprint-11.0E, the `startForeground(...)` call lived
    INSIDE `startCapture()` — AFTER `Builder.establish()` (TUN
    setup, which can take >5s on some OEM ROMs) and AFTER the
    `Builder.establish() == null` early-return path. If TUN
    setup returned null or threw, `startForeground` was NEVER
    called and the 5-second rule was violated.

    The Sprint 11.0E fix hoists the foreground promotion to the
    FIRST statement in `onStartCommand`, BEFORE `startCapture()`.
    The check requires FIVE tokens to be present in
    OpenE2eeVpnService.kt (comment-stripped via the same Kotlin
    comment-strip loop used by S43 / S73):

      1. `startForeground(` — the foreground-service promotion
         call. (Either the typed 3-arg overload on Android 14+,
         or `ServiceCompat.startForeground(...)` on older API
         levels — both contain this substring.)
      2. `FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_SPECIAL_USE` (or
         `ServiceInfo.FOREGROUND_SERVICE_TYPE_SPECIAL_USE`) — the
         typed foregroundServiceType for VPN services not
         classified as "system" (Android 14+ strict mode).
      3. `createNotificationChannel` (or
         `ensureNotificationChannel`) — the Android 8+
         notification-channel creator. The brief's
         Senaryo 2 says missing this is the silent-no-op
         failure mode.
      4. `onStartCommand` — the service-lifecycle hook where
         `startForeground()` must run as the first statement.
      5. `onStartCommand` body must reference `startForeground`
         BEFORE `Builder.establish()` — verified by
         `onStartCommand` containing both the startForeground
         call AND the `else if (running.get() == false)`
         branch (which is the startCapture call site).

    Missing ANY of these re-opens the RemoteServiceException
    crash window.

    """Sprint 11.0F + 11.0G: vpn_service.dart exposes VpnService as a Dart singleton (S76).

    Regression guard for the OnePlus 9 Pro Senaryo D
    regression (Owner 11:01 / 11:25 reports): the Kotlin
    service was running, the foreground notification was
    visible, but the UI's state pill stayed on "HAZIRLANIYOR"
    and the packet count never incremented. Root cause: every
    widget rebuild constructed a fresh `VpnService()` in
    `active_pool_screen.dart` line 70, which (a) replaced the
    previous `_channel.setMethodCallHandler` on the global
    `opene2ee/vpn` channel — events landed on whichever
    instance was constructed LAST (typically `PoolNotifier`
    in the Riverpod provider graph, not the screen), and
    (b) created a fresh `_packetCtrl` / `_stateCtrl`
    StreamController — the UI's old listeners never saw
    updates.

    Sprint 11.0G tightening (Owner 11:25): the 11.0F form had
    `factory VpnService() => _instance` (a back-compat factory
    that still allowed `VpnService()` to be called from
    external code). The factory masked the singleton
    requirement at code-review time. 11.0G REMOVES the public
    factory — only `VpnService.instance` (singleton) and
    `VpnService.forTesting(...)` (test override) remain
    callable. The check now requires:
      1. `VpnService._internal(` OR `VpnService._(` — the
         private constructor used by the static `_instance`
         initializer. The 11.0G form uses `VpnService._` (single
         underscore) for stricter privacy; the 11.0F form used
         `_internal`. Both are accepted.
      2. `static VpnService get instance` (or
         `static final VpnService _instance`) — the singleton
         accessor.
      3. The default `VpnService()` ctor MUST NOT be present
         in non-comment form. The check verifies that the
         only `VpnService(` occurrences are either the private
         `_internal(` / `_(` form, the static `instance`
         getter, or the `forTesting` factory.

    Missing any of these re-opens the Senaryo D regression.

    Regression guard for the OnePlus 9 Pro Senaryo D + UI
    propagation regression (Owner 11:25 report). The 11.0F
    singleton fix was necessary but not sufficient — Owner
    confirmed: the singleton IS in place but the UI's state
    pill still doesn't update because the screen's
    `_vpn = VpnService()` call site (line 70) kept the
    regression surface opaque (the call shape
    `VpnService()` was indistinguishable from a fresh-instance
    ctor at code-review time, even though the factory
    returned the singleton).

    The 11.0G fix has THREE parts:
      1. The default `VpnService()` ctor is REMOVED —
         only `VpnService.instance` and
         `VpnService.forTesting(...)` remain callable
         (enforced by S76).
      2. The `active_pool_screen.dart` uses the explicit
         `VpnService.instance` form (NOT `VpnService()`).
      3. The state stream subscription calls `setState(...)`
         inside the `listen` callback so the widget rebuilds
         on every state transition.

    This check (S77) verifies parts 2 and 3 for
    `active_pool_screen.dart`:
      1. The screen class extends `ConsumerStatefulWidget` (so
         `ref.watch(vpnServiceProvider)` and `ref.listen(...)`
         are available — the Riverpod DI surface).
      2. The screen has a `stateStream.listen` subscription
         whose callback body contains `setState(` — proving
         that the state transitions are wired to widget
         rebuilds.

    Missing either of these means the UI never propagates
    VPN state, even if the singleton + Kotlin service is
    working correctly. This is the third leg of the 11.0G
    fix: Singleton (11.0F) + Private ctor (11.0G S76) +
    UI propagation (11.0G S77).

    """Sprint 11.0H: OpenE2eeVpnService.kt has state-transition breadcrumbs + TOCTOU guard (S78).

    Regression guard for the OnePlus 9 Pro
    `start` returns `state: DRAINING` regression
    (Owner 11:38 logcat). The 11.0F/11.0G singleton + UI
    propagation fixes were necessary but not sufficient —
    the Kotlin-side `startCapture` was racing with a
    `stopCapture` (likely Magisk Zygisk revoke on a rooted
    OnePlus) so the `startCapture` finished setting
    `state = SAMPLING` but the racing `stopCapture` then
    set `state = DRAINING` and the result returned to Dart
    was the DRAINING state (not SAMPLING).

    The Sprint 11.0H fix has THREE parts:
      1. State-transition `Log.d` / `Log.w` breadcrumbs at
         each step of `startCapture` / `stopCapture` /
         `onRevoke` so the next regression is diagnosable
         via `adb logcat -d -s OpenE2eeVpn:V` (the
         `state: DRAINING` symptom doesn't include a
         stacktrace, so the only signal is the
         breadcrumb order).
      2. A `synchronized(stateLock)` TOCTOU guard around
         `startCapture` and `stopCapture` so the
         start/stop race is impossible — the second
         invocation waits for the first to complete.
      3. An explicit `Log.w` on `onRevoke` (the
         system-side revoke callback) so the Owner can
         distinguish Magisk/system revoke from a manual
         Dart-side `stop()`.

    This check (S78) requires FOUR tokens in
    `OpenE2eeVpnService.kt` (comment-stripped):
      1. `startCapture: SAMPLING started` literal — proves
         the state-transition log is present at the
         happy-path point.
      2. `stopCapture: called` literal — proves the
         stop-path entry log is present (so the
         `adb logcat` output shows WHERE stop was called
         from).
      3. `onRevoke:` literal — proves the system-revoke
         path is instrumented.
      4. `synchronized(` literal paired with a `stateLock`
         reference — proves the TOCTOU guard is in place.

    """Sprint 11.0J: OpenE2eeVpnService.kt has TUN passthrough (S80).

    Regression guard for the OnePlus 9 Pro "VPN active,
    internet dead" symptom (Owner 12:14 report, PID 4244,
    `state: DRAINING, packetsObserved: 0, ringSize: 0`).
    The 11.0I fix (`.addRoute("0.0.0.0", 0)`) is necessary
    but not sufficient — without the TUN passthrough pattern
    in the reader thread, the kernel drops all packets the
    TUN consumes from the input side. Result: the OS
    triggers a system-side `onRevoke()` after 5-30s (no
    network connectivity = VPN profile is "misbehaving")
    and the `state: DRAINING` regression returns.

    The fundamental VPN capture pattern:
      1. Open TUN INPUT stream (read packets from kernel).
      2. Open TUN OUTPUT stream (write packets back to kernel).
      3. For each packet: read from input, capture metadata
         for analytics, WRITE THE SAME BYTES BACK to the
         output (the kernel then routes the packet out the
         device's real NIC).

    Pre-11.0J, the code opened ONLY the input stream and
    never wrote to the output. The `protect(Socket)` call
    was a no-op (it marks a SOCKET as "not VPN-routed" but
    there's no socket to route). 11.0J removes the bogus
    `protect()` call and adds the `output.write(buf, 0, n)`
    passthrough.

    The check requires THREE tokens in `OpenE2eeVpnService.kt`
    (comment-stripped):
      1. `output.write(buf` OR `tunOutput.write(` OR
         `tun.write(` literal present — the passthrough
         write call.
      2. `input.read(buf` OR `tunInput.read` OR
         `tun.read` literal present — the input read call.
      3. The `protect(Socket)` no-op is NOT present in
         non-comment form (anti-pattern guard — the
         11.0A-era `protect()` was a misconception).

    Missing any of these re-opens the "internet dead"
    regression.

    """Sprint 11.0K: OpenE2eeVpnService.kt dispatches MethodChannel
    calls to the Android main looper (S82).

    Regression guard for the OnePlus 9 Pro "VPN active, internet
    working, UI never updates" symptom (Owner 12:31 logcat, PID 4244,
    98 packets in 80s, PacketDrain `deltaPerInterval` Log.d IS in
    logcat, but `state: DRAINING, packetsObserved: 0, ringSize: 0`
    stays frozen in the UI).

    REAL root cause (overriding the 11.0K brief hypothesis): the
    Flutter Engine requires `MethodChannel.invokeMethod` to be called
    on the Android UI thread (the main `Looper`). Pre-11.0K, the
    three call sites (flushTelemetry's `onTelemetry`, notifyError's
    `onError`, PacketDrain's `onPacketsSampled`) invoked
    `methodChannel?.invokeMethod` directly from their caller
    threads:
      - `flushTelemetry` is called from the TUN reader thread
        (`startReaderThread`).
      - `notifyError` is called from `startCapture` and
        `startReaderThread`.
      - `PacketDrain.run` is the `opene2ee-vpn-drain`
        ScheduledExecutorService worker thread.
    The engine threw `@UiThread: Methods marked with @UiThread must
    be executed on the main thread. Current thread:
    opene2ee-vpn-drain` and Dart never received any of the three
    events. The Owner saw `state: DRAINING` because the Dart
    `stateStream.listen` callback never fired.

    11.0K fix:
      1. Companion declares `@JvmField val mainHandler: Handler =
         Handler(Looper.getMainLooper())` (eagerly initialized at
         class-load time so the first push from a worker thread
         does not have to construct the Handler).
      2. All three call sites dispatch via `mainHandler.post { ... }`
         — flushTelemetry and notifyError go through a
         `pushToDart(method, args)` helper; PacketDrain inlines
         the post.
      3. New imports: `android.os.Handler` + `android.os.Looper`.

    The check requires FIVE tokens in `OpenE2eeVpnService.kt`

      1. `import android.os.Handler` literal present.
      2. `import android.os.Looper` literal present.
      3. `Handler(Looper.getMainLooper())` literal present
         (the companion `mainHandler` field).
      4. `mainHandler.post` literal present (the dispatch call).
      5. NO direct `methodChannel?.invokeMethod(` OR
