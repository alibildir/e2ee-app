— `checkDebugAarMetadata` could not find the engine JAR because
Flutter storage Maven repo was not declared in settings.gradle.kts
`dependencyResolutionManagement`; Sprint 9.7.0 Item 1 (foundation)
PR #27 — CLEAN fresh Flutter Android skeleton via
`flutter create --platforms=android` — required the audit to grow
fresh-skeleton preservation invariants S17-S20 so future sprints
that re-touch mobile/ (port VPN service, MethodChannels, screens)
cannot silently regress the buildable-artifact contract).

Verifies:
  1. All 4 workflows have ONLY workflow_dispatch trigger (no push/pull_request).
  2. android-debug.yml has subosito/flutter-action@v2 step.
  3. android-debug.yml's `Setup Flutter` step pins flutter-version
     (Sprint 9.6.2 fix — Sprint 9.6.1 had `channel: stable` only, which
     caused ${FLUTTER_HOME} to resolve to empty in the runner).
  4. android-debug.yml's `Generate local.properties` step writes flutter.sdk
     echo derived from `which flutter` (Sprint 9.6.2 fix — Sprint 9.6.1
     used `${FLUTTER_HOME}` which was empty, causing settings.gradle.kts
     `includeBuild("")` = `/packages/flutter_tools/gradle` to FAIL).
  5. android-debug.yml has `Verify Flutter SDK path` step
     (fast-fail signal BEFORE ./gradlew assembleDebug).
  6. ci.yml/ios.yml/android-release.yml have NO inputs.runner
     (matrix/single-runner workflows don't need it).
  7. **Sprint 9.6.3:** gradle-wrapper.properties distributionUrl must be
     >= 8.7.0 (Flutter 3.44.1 minimum).
  8. **Sprint 9.6.4:** mobile/android/build.gradle.kts AGP plugin version
     must be >= 8.6.0 (Flutter 3.44.1 minimum).
  9. **Sprint 9.6.5:** build.gradle.kts Kotlin plugin version must be
     >= 2.2 (Flutter 3.44.1 soon-dropped floor).
 10. **Sprint 9.6.6 (v2):** app/build.gradle.kts Kotlin DSL syntax check
     with 5 sub-checks (S1-S5):
     S1. real `import java.util.Properties` statement exists at line start
         (NOT substring in a comment — Sprint 9.6.5 had a false-positive
         match on a comment claiming the import was added).
     S2. real `import org.jetbrains.kotlin.gradle.dsl.JvmTarget` statement
         exists (required by kotlin { compilerOptions } block).
     S3. deprecated `kotlinOptions { jvmTarget = "..." }` block is NOT
         present in code (Kotlin 2.0+ deprecation warning treated as
         build error in CI by AGP 8.11.1 + Kotlin 2.2.20).
     S4. new `kotlin { compilerOptions { jvmTarget.set(JvmTarget.JVM_17) } }`
         block IS present in code (correct Kotlin 2.0+ replacement).
     S5. fully-qualified `java.util.Properties()` usage is NOT present
         in code (must use short form `Properties()` after the import).
 11. **Sprint 9.6.7 (v3):** android-debug.yml `flutter pub get` step check
      (S6):
      The CI runner resolves `./gradlew assembleDebug` →
      `:app:compileFlutterBuildDebug` which needs
      `mobile/.dart_tool/package_config.json`. That file is NEVER
      produced unless a step runs `flutter pub get` with
      `working-directory: ./mobile` (the Dart project root, where
      `pubspec.yaml` lives — NOT `./mobile/android`). S6 verifies:
      (a) step name matches "Install Flutter dependencies" (case-
          insensitive substring on parsed `name` field, not raw text),
      (b) step `run` field contains "flutter pub get",
      (c) step `working-directory` is EXACTLY "./mobile".
      Uses PyYAML-parsed step dicts (Sprint 9.6.5 comment-claim
      lesson reapplies — a comment claiming "we run flutter pub get"
      must NOT pass this audit).
 12. **Sprint 9.6.8 (v4):** mobile entry point check (S7) —
      `mobile/lib/main.dart` + `runApp(` + `ProviderScope` +
      `pubspec.yaml` `flutter_riverpod:` + `go_router:`. PyYAML-
      parsed pubspec deps (comment-claim lesson reapplies).
 13. **Sprint 9.6.9 (v5):** Android res/xml/ comment well-formedness
      (S8) — XML 1.0 `<!-- ... -->` may not contain `--`. Uses
      `xml.etree.ElementTree.fromstring` (well-formedness) + regex
      walk over comment bodies (content rule). aapt2 rejects the
      file with 'The string "--" is not permitted within comments'.
 14. **Sprint 9.6.10 (v6):** AndroidManifest merger-spec (S9) —
      no `package=` attr (AGP 8.11.1 ignores / AGP 9 rejects) +
      `xmlns:tools` declared + `tools:replace` (NOT `tools:remove`)
      co-exists with `android:usesCleartextTraffic` + gradle
      `namespace = "..."` declared (cross-check).
 15. **Sprint 9.6.11 (v7):** Android res/ skeleton (S10) — mipmap
      ic_launcher representation + `drawable/launch_background.xml`
      + `values/styles.xml` with `LaunchTheme` + `NormalTheme`.
 16. **Sprint 9.6.12 (v8):** mobile/.flutter-plugins-dependencies
      regen (S11) — file exists, parses as JSON via `json.load`
      (real parser, per the 9.6.x chain rule "audit must use a
      real parser, not a regex-grep heuristic"), `plugins.android[]`
      non-empty with `name` + `native_build` per entry. The Flutter
      Gradle plugin reads this file to wire engine JARs into the
      Kotlin compile classpath; without it, `compileDebugKotlin`
      fails with 40+ 'Unresolved reference embedding/FlutterActivity/
      FlutterEngine/MethodChannel' errors.
      [NB: S11 was right-but-insufficient. The actual root cause of
       the 9.6.12 / 9.6.13 live build FAIL was a missing
       `io.flutter:flutter_embedding_ktx` Maven coordinate in
       `app/build.gradle.kts` `dependencies { }` — a Kotlin-side
       issue. `.flutter-plugins-dependencies` is Dart-side
       metadata and does not contribute to the Kotlin classpath.
       S12 was added in Sprint 9.6.13 to close the Kotlin-side
       gap.]
 17. **Sprint 9.6.13 (v9):** app/build.gradle.kts
      `flutter_embedding_ktx` declared (S12) — the Maven
      coordinate `io.flutter:flutter_embedding_ktx:1.0.0-<engine
      _commit>` appears inside the `dependencies { }` block AND
      the `<engine_commit>` hash matches the value in
      `$flutterSdkPath/bin/internal/engine.version`. Without this
      dependency, `compileDebugKotlin` fails with 40+ "Unresolved
      reference embedding/FlutterActivity/FlutterEngine/
      MethodChannel" errors in MainActivity.kt + OpenE2eeVpnService.kt.
      Missing since PR-3 (the original Android Gradle scaffolding).
18. **Sprint 9.6.14 (v10):** Flutter engine Maven repo declared
       (S13) — `dependencyResolutionManagement { repositories { ...
       maven { url = uri("https://storage.googleapis.com/download.
       flutter.io") ... } } }` in `settings.gradle.kts` (or
       `app/build.gradle.kts` `repositories { }` as fallback).
       Without this, AGP-managed tasks (e.g.
       `:app:checkDebugAarMetadata`) cannot resolve
       `io.flutter:flutter_embedding_ktx` because the Flutter Gradle
       plugin auto-registers this repo only for the Dart-side
       `compileFlutterBuildDebug` task — NOT for AGP tasks.
  19. **Sprint 9.7.0 Item 5 (v11):** Gradle wrapper force-include
       (S17) — `mobile/android/gradlew` + `mobile/android/gradlew.bat`
       + `mobile/android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar` are TRACKED
       by git (via `git ls-files`, the same data source the audit
       chain has used since Sprint 9.6.1) AND the repo-root
       `.gitignore` has matching `!**/android/gradlew`,
       `!**/android/gradlew.bat`, `!**/android/gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar`
       re-include lines. Sprint 9.7.0 Item 1 wiped `mobile/` and
       re-scaffolded via `flutter create --platforms=android`; the
       default `flutter create` template excludes the wrapper as a
       "generated artifact" — a fresh clone without force-include
       would have no gradlew and the CI runner's `chmod +x
       ./mobile/android/gradlew` step would fail with "No such file
       or directory". This invariant prevents a future
       `flutter create` re-run from silently regressing the
       buildable-artifact contract.
  20. **Sprint 9.7.0 Item 5 (v11):** Fresh `flutter create`
       preservation (S18) — `mobile/pubspec.lock` is TRACKED by git,
       parses as YAML (real parser, per the 9.6.x chain rule), has
       a `packages.flutter` entry with `source: sdk` (Flutter SDK
       SHA pin), AND the repo-root `.gitignore` retains the
       mobile-specific Flutter exclusion rules
       (`**/android/.gradle/`, `**/android/local.properties`,
       `**/.dart_tool/`, `**/.flutter-plugins-dependencies`). Sprint
       9.7.0 Item 1 wiped the e2ee-app pubspec.lock and re-generated
       a fresh one via `flutter create` + `flutter pub get`; if a
       future sprint strips these rules or un-tracks pubspec.lock,
       CI reproducibility breaks (lockfile-driven SHA mismatch).
  21. **Sprint 9.7.0 Item 5 (v11):** Fresh `flutter create`
       local-level metadata tracked (S19) — `mobile/.metadata` AND
       `mobile/android/.gitignore` are both TRACKED by git. The
       `.metadata` file marks the directory as a Flutter project
       for tooling (IDE detection, `flutter doctor` heuristics); the
       `android/.gitignore` carries the un-ignore rules + rationale
       block specific to the Android subdir (see Sprint 9.7.0 Item 1
       attempt-2 delta). Without both, a `git clone` of the fresh
       skeleton is not a valid Flutter Android project from the
       tooling's point of view.
  22. **Sprint 9.7.0 Item 5 (v11):** pubspec.yaml baseline shape
        (S20) — `mobile/pubspec.yaml` parses as YAML (real parser)
        AND has the minimum keys every Flutter Android skeleton must
        have for `flutter pub get` + `flutter create --platforms=android`
        to round-trip cleanly: `name:`, `environment.sdk:`,
        `dependencies.flutter.sdk: flutter`,
        `dev_dependencies.flutter_test.sdk: flutter`. The fresh
        skeleton template generated by `flutter create` ships with
        all four; if a future sprint edits pubspec.yaml in a way that
        drops one (e.g. removes the `flutter_test` dev-dep), the
        `widget_test.dart` smoke test breaks and the foundation is
        compromised.
  23. **Sprint 10.1C:** PoolState debug-state fields (S33) —
        `mobile/lib/state/pool_provider.dart` declares BOTH
        `lastError` AND `lastSuccess` field literals. The active
        pool screen's `ref.listen<PoolState>(...)` snackbar
        handler reads these names verbatim. Removing either
        field re-introduces the silent-failure mode Owner flagged
        on 10.07.2026 22:21 ("hiç tepki yok gibi" — "feels like
        nothing is happening").
  24. **Sprint 10.1C:** ScaffoldMessenger snackbar in active pool
        screen (S34) — `mobile/lib/screens/active_pool_screen.dart`
        contains the literal
        `ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar`. Without the
        literal call, the `ref.listen<PoolState>(...)` block
        compiles to a no-op and the Owner-facing debug feedback
        is silently dropped.
  25. **Sprint 10.1C:** build-time API key (S35) — at least one
        of `mobile/lib/services/telemetry_service.dart` OR
        `mobile/lib/services/p2p_matcher.dart` contains the
        literal `String.fromEnvironment('API_KEY'`. Without the
        call, the `--dart-define API_KEY=<key>` build flag is
        silently ignored and the hardcoded placeholder reaches
        the wire (Owner directive 10.07.2026 22:25).
  26. **Sprint 10.1D:** auth_service.dart exists with POST +
        /api/v1/auth + user_id literals (S36) — the JWT auth
        flow files. The endpoint + body shape is the contract
        with the backend BFF aggregator.
  27. **Sprint 10.1D:** authHeaders() in telemetry_service or
        p2p_matcher (S37) — the protected endpoints must call
        `_auth.authHeaders()` (Future<Map<String, String>>),
        NOT send a static `Authorization: Bearer <key>` line.
  28. **Sprint 10.1D:** _tokenExpiresAt field in
        auth_service.dart (S38) — the JWT token-cache state.
        `getToken()` uses it for the 5-min pre-expiry refresh
        window (Owner directive 10.07.2026 22:33).
  29. **Sprint 10.1D:** invalidate() method in
        auth_service.dart (S39) — the 401-retry contract.
        Downstream services call `_auth.invalidate()` when the
        backend rejects the JWT; the next call re-auths.
  30. **Sprint 10.1E:** WhatsApp deep link Android Intent
        format in `whatsapp_deeplink_provider.dart` (S40) — the
        `whatsapp_deeplink_provider.dart` file must carry BOTH
        the `intent://send?` prefix AND the
        `#Intent;scheme=whatsapp;package=com.whatsapp;end` suffix
        literal. Sprint 10.0's `whatsapp://send?text=` scheme was
        unreliable on Android (MIUI / OEM ROMs silently no-op'd
        the launch); the new Android Intent URI forces
        PackageManager to route to the WhatsApp package. Both
        halves of the URI are load-bearing — dropping either
        makes the launch silently no-op.
  31. **Sprint 10.1E:** P2PMatcher uses `/api/v1/sessions`
        (S41) — the `p2p_matcher.dart` file must contain the
        literal `/api/v1/sessions` AND must NOT contain the
        literal `/api/v1/matches` (the 10.1B/10.1D path that
        404'd because the backend never had that route).
        Mobile-side filter (status=active, role=receiver,
        device_id_hash != self) replaces the missing server-side
        match endpoint per the brief's option C.

    A live workflow_dispatch run AFTER Sprint 9.6.6 (PR planned #17,
    commit e57da24) FAILED at :app:compileFlutterBuildDebug with:
        "mobile/.dart_tool/package_config.json does not exist.
         Did you run this command from the same directory as your
         pubspec.yaml file?"
    The `flutter --version` step that exists at the end of the
    workflow is NOT a substitute for `flutter pub get` — it only
    prints the version, it does not generate the package_config.json
    file that the Flutter Android Gradle plugin reads at build time.

    The fix: add a new step
        - name: Install Flutter dependencies
          working-directory: ./mobile
          run: flutter pub get
    between the existing `Verify Flutter dependency cache` step
    (current step 9) and the existing `Build Debug APK` step
    (current step 10). `working-directory: ./mobile` is mandatory
    because `pubspec.yaml` lives in the Dart project root, not the
    Android Gradle subproject (`./mobile/android`).

    This check verifies all three properties on the SAME step:

      (a) Step name matches `Install Flutter dependencies` (case-
          insensitive substring match on the `name` field).
      (b) Step `run` field contains `flutter pub get` (case-
          insensitive substring).
      (c) Step `working-directory` is exactly `./mobile` (NOT
          `./mobile/android`, NOT absent, NOT empty).

    The check uses PyYAML-parsed step dicts (not raw text substring
    search) — applying the Sprint 9.6.5 lesson that a comment
    claiming "we run flutter pub get" must NOT pass the audit.

    Failure messages report the actual `working-directory` value
    seen (if any) so a future false-positive is debuggable.

    """Sprint 9.6.8 v4: mobile app entry point check (S7).

    A live workflow_dispatch run AFTER Sprint 9.6.7 merge
    (commit bbf7087) FAILED because `flutter build apk` could not
    find `mobile/lib/main.dart` — the Flutter mobile default entry
    point. The repo had `mobile/lib/web/main.dart` (for the web
    dashboard) but no `mobile/lib/main.dart` (for the mobile build).
    The `flutter pub get` step from Sprint 9.6.7 succeeded (it
    resolves the package graph), but the build still failed at
    `:app:compileFlutterBuildDebug` with "could not find main entry
    point".

    This sprint (9.6.8) creates the entry point + the full app
    shell. The audit must verify all three preconditions for a
    buildable mobile app:

      (a) `mobile/lib/main.dart` exists (the entry point).
      (b) The file has `runApp(` (calls runApp) AND
          `ProviderScope` (Riverpod wiring). A comment claiming
          "we run Riverpod" must NOT pass — the check uses
          `pathlib` + content read (substrings on the actual
          file content).
      (c) `mobile/pubspec.yaml` declares BOTH `flutter_riverpod:`
          AND `go_router:` as dependencies. Parsed via PyYAML
          (not substring) so a comment claiming "we use Riverpod"
          in the pubspec must NOT pass.

    Failure messages name the missing condition so a future
    regression is debuggable.

    """Sprint 9.6.9 v5: XML comment well-formedness check (S8).

    The 9.6.8 live build (commit edd3023 on main, fast-forward
    merged by Owner) advanced past `compileFlutterBuildDebug` for
    the first time in the 9.6.x chain. The next task,
    `:app:mergeDebugResources`, failed because
    `mobile/android/app/src/main/res/xml/network_security_config.xml`
    contained XML comments with `--` runs (e.g. `---------------`).
    The XML 1.0 spec forbids `--` inside `<!-- ... -->`; Android's
    `aapt2` / `ResourceCompiler` enforces this and rejects the
    file with `The string "--" is not permitted within comments`.

    This check enforces the rule statically so a future
    regression cannot land:

      (a) Every `*.xml` under
          `mobile/android/app/src/main/res/xml/` parses as
          well-formed XML via `xml.etree.ElementTree.fromstring`
          (Python's stdlib XML 1.0 parser — same rule aapt2 uses
          up to differences in namespace handling).
      (b) No `<!-- ... -->` comment body contains a `--` run
          (the regex finds `--` INSIDE comments; the legitimate
          `<!--` opener and `-->` closer are stripped first by
          walking the comment match bounds).

    Implementation notes (apply 9.6.5 lesson): we DO NOT
    regex-grep raw text for `--` — we use `ET.fromstring` to
    validate well-formedness AND iterate the captured comment
    text from a regex pass to assert no `--` run lives inside.
    A comment that LEGITIMATELY contains the text "the `--`
    keyword" would still fail (correct: the only way to write
    that in XML is to break the comment into two comments,
    e.g. `<!-- the --><!--  keyword -->` — accepted XML
    limitation, see https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#sec-comments).

    Scope: only `mobile/android/app/src/main/res/xml/*.xml`.
    We do NOT scan `mobile/lib/` Dart sources, and we do NOT
    scan the broader `mobile/android/` tree (CI's `aapt2` is
    what cares about the resource dir, not arbitrary XML).

def check_android_manifest_v6() -> list[str]:
    """Sprint 9.6.10 v6: AndroidManifest.xml well-formedness + merger-spec check (S9).

    The 9.6.9 live build (commit c469959 on main, fast-forward
    merged by Owner) advanced past `mergeDebugResources` and
    `parseDebugLocalResources` (XML comments fixed). The next
    task, `:app:processDebugMainManifest`, failed because:

      (a) `mobile/android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml`
          declared `package="com.opene2ee.opene2ee"` on the
          root `<manifest>` element. AGP 8.11.1 rejects this in
          favour of the `namespace` declared in
          `build.gradle.kts` ("Setting the namespace via the
          package attribute in the source AndroidManifest.xml is
          no longer supported"). The `namespace` is already at
          `mobile/android/app/build.gradle.kts:136`.

      (b) The same `<application>` tag carries
          `android:usesCleartextTraffic="false"` AND
          `tools:remove="android:usesCleartextTraffic"`. The
          merger refuses the redundant/conflicting pair
          ("tools:remove specified at line:63 for attribute
          android:usesCleartextTraffic, but attribute also
          declared at line:68, do you want to use
          tools:replace instead?"). The MOB-1 cyber-security
          finding's intent is "library merge cannot silently
          re-enable plaintext" — the correct directive is
          `tools:replace`.

    This check enforces all of:

      (1) `AndroidManifest.xml` parses as well-formed XML
          (via `xml.etree.ElementTree` — same XML 1.0 parser
          rule aapt2 uses).
      (2) The root `<manifest>` element does NOT carry a
          `package` attribute. AGP 8.x ignores it; AGP 9 will
          reject it outright.
      (3) The root `<manifest>` element DOES declare
          `xmlns:tools="http://schemas.android.com/tools"`
          (required for any `tools:replace` /
          `tools:remove` directive to be recognized).
      (4) Any `<application>` tag that carries
          `android:usesCleartextTraffic` does NOT also carry
          `tools:remove="android:usesCleartextTraffic"`.
          The pair is forbidden; either drop the value and
          keep `tools:remove`, or keep the value and switch to
          `tools:replace`.
      (5) `build.gradle.kts` declares
          `namespace = "com.opene2ee.opene2ee"`. This is the
          cross-check — removing the manifest's `package=`
          is only safe when the gradle namespace is present
          (otherwise the build will fail with "no package
          specified").

    Implementation notes: use `ET.parse` for parse validity,
    iterate via `tree.iter` for the namespace-qualified
    attributes. The `build.gradle.kts` namespace check is a
    substring match (the only place a regex would suffice,
    and it's not security-sensitive — it's a single literal
    string match for the namespace declaration).

    """Sprint 9.6.11 v7: Flutter Android resource skeleton check (S10).

    The 9.6.10 live build (commit 5f3ee01 on main, fast-forward
    merged by Owner) advanced past `processDebugMainManifest` for
    the first time (manifest fix worked). The next task,
    `:app:processDebugResources`, failed because three Android
    resources referenced by AndroidManifest.xml were never
    generated:

      `mipmap/ic_launcher` (app icon)
      `style/LaunchTheme` (launch screen style)
      `style/NormalTheme` (normal theme style)

    The repo's `mobile/android/app/src/main/res/` contained only
    `xml/network_security_config.xml`. The rest of the Flutter
    Android resource skeleton (mipmap-*, drawable/launch_background.xml,
    values/styles.xml, values/colors.xml, values-night/styles.xml)
    was never generated. The repo has had no Flutter Android
    skeleton since PR-3.

    Sprint 9.6.11 ran `flutter create . --platforms=android` and
    kept ONLY the res/ additions (rejected any flutter create
    changes to the preservation list: MainActivity.kt, Android
    Manifest.xml, build.gradle.kts, lib/*, pubspec.yaml, test/).

    This check verifies that the skeleton stays intact:

      (a) `mobile/android/app/src/main/res/values/styles.xml`
          exists AND contains both `<style name="LaunchTheme">`
          AND `<style name="NormalTheme">` (parse with
          xml.etree.ElementTree). aapt2 rejects the manifest
          without these styles.
      (b) AT LEAST ONE mipmap representation of the app icon
          exists — either `mipmap-anydpi-v26/ic_launcher.xml`
          (adaptive icon) OR any density's
          `mipmap-{mdpi,hdpi,xhdpi,xxhdpi,xxxhdpi}/ic_launcher.png`
          (legacy raster). aapt2 rejects the manifest
          without `mipmap/ic_launcher`.
      (c) `mobile/android/app/src/main/res/drawable/launch_background.xml`
          exists. Referenced by `LaunchTheme`'s `windowBackground`.

    We do NOT check exact file contents (icon design, color palette,
    etc.) — a future visual design sprint can refine. The audit's
    job is "is the skeleton present", not "is the design good".

def check_flutter_plugins_dependencies_v8() -> list[str]:
    """Sprint 9.6.12 v8: mobile/.flutter-plugins-dependencies regen check (S11).

    The 9.6.11 live build (commit f4881cd on main, fast-forward
    merged by Owner) advanced past `processDebugResources` for the
    first time (resource skeleton fix worked). The next task,
    `:app:compileDebugKotlin`, failed with 40+ "Unresolved
    reference" errors in `MainActivity.kt` and `OpenE2eeVpnService.kt`:

        e: MainActivity.kt:39:19 Unresolved reference 'embedding'.
        e: MainActivity.kt:48:22 Unresolved reference 'FlutterActivity'.
        e: MainActivity.kt:57:37 Unresolved reference 'MethodChannel'.
        e: OpenE2eeVpnService.kt:103:19 Unresolved reference 'embedding'.
        e: OpenE2eeVpnService.kt:184:36 Unresolved reference 'FlutterEngine'.
        e: OpenE2eeVpnService.kt:251:32 Unresolved reference 'MethodChannel'.

    The Kotlin compiler cannot find `io.flutter.embedding.*` and
    `io.flutter.plugin.*` because the Flutter engine JAR is not on
    the compile classpath. The Flutter Gradle plugin (`app_plugin_
    loader.gradle` under `$FLUTTER_HOME/packages/flutter_tools/
    gradle/`) reads `mobile/.flutter-plugins-dependencies` to
    discover the set of Flutter plugins and wire their generated
    classes + the engine JARs into the Kotlin compile classpath.

    Sprint 9.6.7 added the `flutter pub get` step to
    `android-debug.yml` (S6 — `Install Flutter dependencies` with
    `working-directory: ./mobile`). That step regenerates
    `.flutter-plugins-dependencies` on the CI runner BEFORE the
    `Build Debug APK` step, so the engine JARs are wired into the
    classpath.

    However, the file is gitignored (`**/.flutter-plugins-
    dependencies` in repo-root `.gitignore` line 96), so when a
    Coder worktree is created from a clean main checkout, the file
    is ABSENT. `flutter pub get` must be run locally to regenerate
    it. If a future commit changes the pubspec dependency graph
    (adds/removes a Flutter plugin) without re-running `flutter
    pub get` AND the workflow's `flutter pub get` step is
    accidentally removed or misconfigured, the build will fail at
    `compileDebugKotlin` with the symptoms above.

    This check enforces the LOCAL pre-build state:

      (a) `mobile/.flutter-plugins-dependencies` exists.
      (b) The file parses as JSON via `json.load` (real parser,
          per the 9.6.x chain rule "audit must use a real
          parser, not a regex-grep heuristic").
      (c) `plugins.android` is a non-empty list (at least one
          Android plugin declared). Without this list, the
          Flutter Gradle plugin has no Android plugins to wire
          and (in some configurations) no engine JAR to add to
          the Kotlin classpath.
      (d) Each entry in `plugins.android` has both `name` (str)
          and `native_build` (bool) fields — the schema
          `flutter pub get` writes.

    Failure messages report the actual observed state (file
    missing / JSON parse error / empty array / missing fields)
    so a future regression is debuggable. We do NOT
    cross-validate against `mobile/pubspec.yaml` deps here — that
    is a stricter check that the live `flutter pub get` step is
    already responsible for (S6 invariant). This audit's job is
    "is the generated state consistent", not "do the pubspec
    deps match".

    Scope: only `mobile/.flutter-plugins-dependencies`. We do
    NOT scan the analogous `ios` array or any sibling
    Dart-side state — iOS / web / desktop plugins are not on
    the Android Kotlin classpath.

    The 9.6.12 live build (commit b52a0f6 on main, fast-forward
    merged by Owner) FAILED at `:app:compileDebugKotlin` with
    40+ "Unresolved reference 'embedding' / 'FlutterActivity' /
    'FlutterEngine' / 'MethodChannel'" errors in `MainActivity.kt`
    and `OpenE2eeVpnService.kt` — IDENTICAL to the 9.6.11 failure.

    Sprint 9.6.12's Coder root-cause (Fix A: `.flutter-plugins-
    dependencies` was missing in the worktree) was a surface
    artifact, NOT the actual root cause. `.flutter-plugins-
    dependencies` is a JSON plugin-list artifact read by the
    Flutter Gradle plugin to wire Dart-side plugin code; it does
    NOT contribute to the Kotlin compile classpath.

    The REAL root cause (Mavis verified, Coder independently
    confirmed in Sprint 9.6.13 Phase 0): `mobile/android/app/
    build.gradle.kts` `dependencies { }` block was MISSING the
    `io.flutter:flutter_embedding_ktx` Maven coordinate. The
    `dev.flutter.flutter-gradle-plugin` plugin wires the engine
    JAR into `compileFlutterBuildDebug` (Dart side) but does NOT
    propagate it to `compileDebugKotlin` (Kotlin side, run by
    Android Gradle Plugin as a separate task). Every
    `io.flutter.embedding.*` and `io.flutter.plugin.*` import in
    `MainActivity.kt` (PR-22a) and `OpenE2eeVpnService.kt`
    (PR-28) failed to resolve.

    This dependency has been missing since PR-3 (the original
    Android Gradle scaffolding). PR-28 (Sprint 5) declared
    `id("dev.flutter.flutter-gradle-plugin")` and `flutter {
    source = "../.." }` but never added the Kotlin embedding JAR.
    From PR-3 through 9.6.11, `compileFlutterBuildDebug` always
    failed FIRST in the live build, so `compileDebugKotlin` never
    had a chance to fail and expose this gap. Sprint 9.6.11 fixed
    the res/ skeleton, so the build finally reached
    `compileDebugKotlin` and the missing dependency surfaced.

    The fix: add ONE line to the `dependencies { }` block:
        implementation("io.flutter:flutter_embedding_ktx:1.0.0-<engine_commit>")
    where `<engine_commit>` is the 40-char hex SHA from
    `$flutterSdkPath/bin/internal/engine.version`. The Maven
    artifact is published to https://storage.googleapis.com/
    download.flutter.io/ and maven.google.com; Gradle fetches it
    automatically when declared.

    This check enforces the post-fix state:

      (a) `mobile/android/app/build.gradle.kts` exists.
      (b) The file contains a `dependencies { ... }` block
          (substring match — we deliberately do NOT use a full
          Kotlin parser because the dependency block is short
          and substring is sufficient, AND a regex would risk the
          same false-positive pattern Sprint 9.6.5 audit had
          when substring matched a comment claiming a dependency
          was added but the file did not actually have it).
      (c) Inside the `dependencies { }` block, the string
          `io.flutter:flutter_embedding_ktx` appears (substring
          match within the block).
      (d) The version follows the `1.0.0-<40-char-hex>` pattern
          (regex `^1.0.0-[0-9a-f]{40}$` on the captured
          version string — the dot in `1.0.0` is a literal `.`,
          not a regex metachar).
      (e) The hash matches the value in
          `$flutterSdkPath/bin/internal/engine.version` (read it,
          compare as strings).

    Failure messages name the actual observed state so a future
    regression is debuggable (NOT a generic "this dependency is
    missing" string). The audit pinpoints which sub-check failed.

    Scope: only `mobile/android/app/build.gradle.kts`. We do NOT
    scan the workspace `build.gradle.kts` (root) or other module
    build files — the embedding JAR is a per-app dependency.

    """Sprint 9.6.14 v10: Flutter engine Maven repo config check (S13).

    The 9.6.13 live build (commit 7441667 on main, fast-forward
    merged by Owner) advanced past `:app:compileDebugKotlin` for
    the first time — Sprint 9.6.13's `flutter_embedding_ktx`
    dependency declaration worked. The next task,
    `:app:checkDebugAarMetadata`, FAILED with:

        Could not find io.flutter:flutter_embedding_ktx:
            1.0.0-c416acfeb8126e097f758c664aaa3da929e27da0.
        Searched in the following locations:
          - https://dl.google.com/dl/android/maven2/io/flutter/...
          - https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/io/flutter/...
          - https://storage.googleapis.com/download.flutter.io/io/flutter/...

    The Flutter Gradle plugin (`dev.flutter.flutter-gradle-plugin`)
    auto-registers the `storage.googleapis.com/download.flutter.io`
    repo for the Dart-side `compileFlutterBuildDebug` task
    classpath, but AGP-managed tasks like
    `:app:checkDebugAarMetadata` (Kotlin-side runtime classpath
    resolution) do NOT see those plugin-level registrations — they
    use ONLY the project-side repositories declared in
    `dependencyResolutionManagement` (settings.gradle.kts) or
    `repositories { }` (app/build.gradle.kts).

    This dependency has been missing since PR-28 (Sprint 5) set up
    the Flutter Gradle plugin for the first time. From PR-28
    through 9.6.13, `compileFlutterBuildDebug` always failed FIRST
    in the live build, so `checkDebugAarMetadata` never had a
    chance to fail and expose this gap. Sprint 9.6.13 fixed the
    `compileDebugKotlin` layer (Kotlin-side engine JAR on
    classpath); with that fixed, the build reached
    `checkDebugAarMetadata` and the Maven repo config gap surfaced.

    The artifact `io.flutter:flutter_embedding_ktx:1.0.0-<engine
    _commit>` is published ONLY at `https://storage.googleapis.com/
    download.flutter.io`. It is NOT on Google Maven or Maven
    Central. Gradle must be told to look there.

    This check enforces the post-fix state:

      (a) `mobile/android/settings.gradle.kts` contains a
          `dependencyResolutionManagement` block.
      (b) Inside that block (or in `app/build.gradle.kts` as a
          fallback), the URL `https://storage.googleapis.com/
          download.flutter.io` is declared via
          `maven { url = uri("...") }`.
      (c) The URL itself is well-formed (parseable as an https
          URL — we do NOT hit the network).

    Failure messages name the actual observed state so a future
    regression is debuggable.

    Scope: only `settings.gradle.kts` + `app/build.gradle.kts`.
    The workspace `build.gradle.kts` may have `allprojects {
    repositories { google(); mavenCentral() } }` (deprecated since
    Gradle 7), but those repos are ineffective when
    `dependencyResolutionManagement` is set with
    `PREFER_SETTINGS` mode — the audit correctly excludes the
    `allprojects` approach.
